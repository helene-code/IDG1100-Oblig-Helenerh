<h3>24. Step by step</h3>

<p>A cronjob is a way to schedule a task at a specific time and date</p>

<p>1. Log in to the server you wish to create a cronjob under, by using an SSH</p>

<p>2. Run the following command:
Crontab -e</p>

<p>3. Add you email for where you would like your crontab output to be delivered, or leave it blank</p>

<p>4. Choose an editor ( nano is the simplest)</p>

<p>5. You are now in the editor. Press "esc", and "I" to begin editing the file</p>

<p>6.Put this in top of the editor</p>

<code>#!/bin/bash

The * symbolise different time identifications. Since we want to make the cronjob to run every 30 minutes, this one day, you write:

*/30 * * * * echo

To add the print that write "task scheduled at Date", write: 

*/30 * * * * echo  Echo task scheduled at $(date)</code>


<p>7. Press esc to exit editing the file</p>

<p>8. Type :wq to save and quit the file</p>

<p>The cronjob is now saved, and should print “ TASK scheduled at DATE” and run every 30 minutes that day. </p>

if [ "$input" == "q" ]
then 
exit
fi

if [ "$input" == "1" ]
then 
list_options
echo “A bird"
read -p "Please write your choice: " input
check_answer
fi

if [ "$input" == "2" ]
then
list_options
echo “In Norway."
read -p "Please write your choice: " input
check_answer
fi

if [ "$input" == "3" ]
then
list_options
echo “Christianity."
read -p "Please write your choice: " input
check_answer
fi

if [ "$input" != "1" -a "$input" != "2" -a "$input" != "3" -a "$input" != "q" ]
then
list_options
echo "Invalid input. Please try again using the listed options!"
